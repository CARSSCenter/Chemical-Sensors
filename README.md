Chemical sensing leads for OpenNerve

# About
This repository contains design files for two sensors. The first one uses square wave voltammetry for detection and differentiation of catecholamines such as dopamine and serotonin. The second uses amperometry for measuring concentrations of acetylcholine and pH values.
